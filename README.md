### This is an AQMEN repository for -  
### Introduction to Data Science
### An Introduction to Statistical Concepts for Data Analysis

### Stata Workshop (July 2018)

### A two day hands-on workshop led by Professor Vernon Gayle, University of Edinburgh.

#### Topics: 

The course introduces participants to fundamental concepts in statistics, 
rudimentary data analysis techniques and how to interpret results. 
These skills are fundamental for the successful data analysis and data science.

#### Rationale: 

There are many organisations that increasingly require employees to understand 
data, and to analyse data using statistical methods. 

Many employees do not have formal training in statistics. 

Some employees undertook classes at university, but for many people these 
courses are now a distant memory. 

Understanding fundamental concepts in statistics, rudimentary data analysis 
techniques, and how to interpret results are critical skills for the successful 
analysis of data, which is at the core of data science.

Many organisations report that they have an absence of data analysis skills. 
Other organisations report that some employees have skills but lack confidence
in exercising them. The lack of skills and capacity is currently a major 
obstacle to some organisations undertaking data analysis. 

This course will provide a fast-track introduction for employees wishing to 
begin to analyse data.
