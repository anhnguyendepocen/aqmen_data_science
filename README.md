### An Introduction to Statistical Concepts for Data Analysis

**Topics:** The course introduces participants to fundamental concepts in statistics, rudimentary data analysis techniques and how to interpret results. These skills are critical for the successful analysis of data.

**Rationale:** There are many organisations that increasingly require employees to understand data, and to analyse data using statistical methods. Many employees do not have formal training in statistics. Some employees undertook classes at university, but for many people these courses are now a distant memory. Understanding fundamental concepts in statistics, rudimentary data analysis techniques, and how to interpret results are critical skills for the successful analysis of data. Many organisations report that they have an absence of these skills. Other organisations report that some employees have skills but lack confidence in exercising them. The lack of skills and capacity is currently a major obstacle to some organisations undertaking data analysis. This course will provide a fast-track introduction for employees wishing to begin to analyse data.
